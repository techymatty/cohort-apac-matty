# 🚀 Multi-Agent Productivity Assistant (Google ADK + Cloud)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Multi-Agent AI Productivity Assistant** built using **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Google Cloud Datastore**.

It demonstrates how multiple AI agents can collaborate to manage:

* ✅ Tasks
* 📅 Calendar Events
* 📝 Notes

The system uses a **planner + sub-agent architecture** to handle real-world workflows.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Build a multi-agent AI system that:

* Coordinates between multiple agents
* Stores and retrieves structured data
* Integrates tools (tasks, notes, calendar)
* Handles multi-step workflows
* Deploys as an API-based system
